<h1>Git File Case Mismatch Plugin</h1>
<p>If you are working with case-insensitive file system then case mismatches can arise if the file
case is modified outside the IDE. This plugin detects and optionally fixes file case mismatch
between git and the file system.</p>
<p>Adds <strong>Before Commit</strong> check for file case mismatches between git and the file system
with corrective actions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Change git file case to match file system</li>
  <li>Change file system case to match git</li>
</ul>
